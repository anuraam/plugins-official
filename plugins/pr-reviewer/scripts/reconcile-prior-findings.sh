# reconcile-prior-findings.sh — classify current vs prior findings by fid (step 7).
#
# Why this exists as a real script: fid set-ops are deterministic; agents invent
# incomplete buckets or re-post carried-over findings as duplicates.
#
# Usage:
#   bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/reconcile-prior-findings.sh"
#
# Inputs:
#   /tmp/pr_inline_findings.jsonl   — current findings (must include fid)
#   /tmp/pr_prior_findings.jsonl    — from detect-review-mode / *-detect-prior
#   /tmp/pr_state.env               — REVIEW_MODE, HEAD_SHA, RANGE_BASE
#   /tmp/pr_prior.env               — PRIOR_SUMMARY_SHA (Gate A)
#   /tmp/pr_open_threads.jsonl      — optional; for line±5 dedup
#
# Outputs:
#   /tmp/pr_reconcile.json          — {fixed, carried_over, reopened, new}
#   Rewrites /tmp/pr_inline_findings.jsonl to only the New bucket (re-review)
#   Dedup may also drop findings overlapping open threads (DEDUP_SUPPRESSED)
#   Prints summary counts; appends RECONCILE_* to /tmp/pr_state.env
#
# A prior "open" finding only moves to `fixed` after passing two gates:
#   Gate A — HEAD_SHA must differ from PRIOR_SUMMARY_SHA (the sha the prior
#            review was posted against). Same sha means no commit could
#            possibly have fixed anything; force it to `carried_over` instead
#            — this is a mechanical fallback for a same-sha re-trigger that
#            reaches this script directly (the normal path short-circuits
#            earlier via detect-review-mode.sh's PR_REVIEWER_NOOP gate).
#   Gate B — recompute fids for every line currently in the flagged file at
#            HEAD_SHA (same formula as compute-fid.sh/assign-fids.sh) and
#            confirm this fid is NOT among them. If it still reproduces
#            somewhere in the file, this run's finder simply missed it —
#            that is not evidence the underlying code changed.
# A prior "resolved" finding whose fid reappears in the current scan is a
# regression: bucketed `reopened`, not silently dropped (that used to be an
# actual bug — checking resolved-status before fid-presence caused these to
# vanish from the reconcile output entirely with no comment ever posted).
#
# Note: external-thread "addressed vs still_open" judgment stays with the agent
# (needs reading code). This script only does fid buckets + line±5 dedup.
